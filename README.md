# Tone Indicators

A tone indicator database app, with a "sarcasm sign" funtionality.
Supports deleting, editing, and creating your own tone indicators.

## Why did I create this?

I often encounter situations in daily life where I try to say something in a sarcastic tone, yet my peers still don't recognize it.
Similarly, I often got into the opposite situations of me misreading the tone of someone elses speech.
I resorted to making a literal "sarcasm sign" (A piece of cardboard on a stick with "sarcasm" written on it).
And then I thought: Can I make an app out of this?

## How to use the app

The main screen contains a list of all the tone indicators in the database, with five pre-loaded ones:
/s, /j, /lh, /gen, /srs. Each entry has a tag (/s), a title (sarcasm), a description ('The previous statement was meant sarcastically) and an edit button.
Pressing the edit button opens the edit screen, where the various elements of any indicator can be edited (Careful: leaving the 'Indicator' space empty will delete the tag!).
Tapping on the tag itself makes it fullscreen, so the device itself can be used as a "sarcasm sign".
The floating button at the bottom of the main screen creates a new tag, where the user inputs every element of a tag and saves it.

## Is that it?

Yes, for now. I wouldn't know what other features to add, but if you have suggestions, feel free to tell me!

## This is amazing! I want to support you, how can I do that?

First of all, word of mouth. I want this app to help anyone who needs it, and the best way to let them know this app exists is to tell them!
